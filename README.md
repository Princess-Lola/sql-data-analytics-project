# 🧠 Data Analytics Roadmap | Exploratory & Advanced Analytics

This repository presents a **conceptual roadmap** for Data Analytics — outlining the journey from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to **Advanced Analytics**.  
The diagram serves as a guide for analysts, students, and data enthusiasts who want to understand how data exploration evolves into actionable analytical insights.

## 🚀 Overview

Data analytics is a multi-phase process that starts with exploring and understanding data, then moves toward deeper insights, predictions, and performance evaluations.  
This roadmap visualizes two major branches of analytics:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Discovering patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data.  
2. **Advanced Analytics** – Applying deeper techniques for measurement, segmentation, and performance optimization.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps analysts understand the structure, content, and key relationships in datasets before applying complex models or visualizations.

### Key Steps:
1. **Database Exploration** – Reviewing tables, relationships, and metadata.  
2. **Dimensions Exploration** – Understanding categorical variables and hierarchies.  
3. **Date Exploration** – Analyzing time-based data (years, months, trends).  
4. **Measures Exploration** – Examining numeric metrics (totals, averages, distributions).  
5. **Magnitude** – Measuring the size or importance of data points.  
6. **Ranking** – Identifying top/bottom performers or outliers.

## 📊 Advanced Analytics

Once EDA provides clarity, advanced analytics builds upon it to extract deeper insights and strategic intelligence.

### Key Components:
7. **Change-Over-Time (Trends)** – Detecting growth, decline, or cyclic patterns.  
8. **Cumulative Analysis** – Tracking metrics over time to see progressive totals.  
9. **Performance Analysis** – Evaluating how KPIs evolve across time or categories.  
10. **Part-to-Whole (Proportional)** – Understanding share or contribution within categories.  
11. **Data Segmentation** – Grouping data into meaningful clusters or cohorts.  
12. **Reporting** – Summarizing findings through dashboards or reports for stakeholders.

## 🧩 Learning Goals

This roadmap is intended to help you:
- Identify the **key analytical stages** in a data project.  
- Understand how **EDA feeds into advanced analytics**.  
- Structure your own **Tableau, Power BI, or Python** analysis projects logically.  
- Present your analytical process clearly in reports or portfolios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

While the roadmap is tool-agnostic, these technologies typically support each step:

| Phase | Common Tools |
|-------|---------------|
| Data Exploration | SQL, Excel, Python (Pandas), Tableau, Power BI |
| Advanced Analytics | Tableau, Power BI, Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) |
| Reporting | Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio |
